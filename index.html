        <li>The observation tower was used to spot enemy planes during World War II, as it was thought Bethlehem Steel would be a prime target for attack.</li>
        <li>The Indian Tower sits at the highest point of the original 5,000 acres in Nazareth.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>The site actually is hallowed ground. It was the first Moravian graveyard in the Nazareth area, used from 1744 to 1762.</li>
        <li>The name “Indian graveyard” is a misnomer. Of the 67 burials recorded there, only four were for Native Americans.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>The original structure was a pavilion called "the Summer House" built in 1867 by John Jordan, Jr. He later donated $200 to the Moravian Historical Society to replace the pavilion with the present-day tower, which was completed in 1916.</li>
        <li>People thought originaly that the Indian Tower was used to look for hostile native americans. In actuality, the local Native Americans had assimilated in Pennsylvania, and the tower received its name from the Moravian Graveyard it overlooks.</li>
